AGENT
{
  name = Kienar Fleet Systems
  title = Kienar Fleet Systems
  description = A long time ago, really far away from home Kienar Kerman had the great idea to start a company who's sole purpose was to advance Kerbin's ION propulsion technology.  Turns out he was the first Kerbal to put two ion engines on a small spacecraft.  This twin ion engine design didn't amount to much at first so Kienar got involved with other parts of the Kerbal Space Program.
